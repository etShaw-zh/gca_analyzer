FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,I was just about to do the graphs.,mitchell h,9/24/13 10:04
FirstGame_Electric_5,Are we supposed to graph cost per sensor vs RPN?,akash v,9/24/13 10:05
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,I was about to start the graphs.,robert z,9/24/13 10:05
FirstGame_Electric_5,For both the sensor and the Battery?,akash v,9/24/13 10:06
FirstGame_Electric_5,"Usually, a lower RPN has a higher cost.",brandon l,9/24/13 10:06

FirstGame_PAM_5,"hey team, so what I'm gathering is that we are being encouraged to talk about the graphs",amelia n,9/24/13 10:06
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,"Alright, I'll take that as a no.  Nassim, where do you want us in our research before this meeting continues?",carl b,9/24/13 10:06
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,I'm at that same point Peter.,mitchell h,9/24/13 10:06
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,The graphs will indicate which power source and control sensor to use.  I am actually working on the graph right now so I dont know which is best yet,joseph h,9/24/13 10:06
FirstGame_Electric_5,I feel the Cadmium Battery was the best choice because it is inexpensive and is relatively reliable.,akash v,9/24/13 10:07
FirstGame_Electric_5,The only thing is I think that this one was heavier than the other ones,akash v,9/24/13 10:07
FirstGame_Electric_5,I did not put the numbers into the graph yet. I was just finishing with reading the articles. It does not seem like there are any superior options right now.,brandon l,9/24/13 10:07

FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,I've only finished the power source graph but my graph shows that NiCd batteries have a good balance of all five qualities.,kevin g,9/24/13 10:07
FirstGame_PAM_5,would it be the Nickel Cadmium Battery?,amelia n,9/24/13 10:08
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,Can't we just do the graphs real quick right now?,mitchell h,9/24/13 10:08

FirstGame_Electric_5,"The LiPo battery seems to have many advantages, including its durability, weight, and energy.",brandon l,9/24/13 10:09
FirstGame_PAM_5,based on the Cost per battery/risk priority?,amelia n,9/24/13 10:09
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,Does anyone know how long they take?,carl b,9/24/13 10:09
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,"Some people are really behind, but I think 10pm is a fair time for everyone to get caught up.",carl b,9/24/13 10:09
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,Why don't we all do our graphs and submit a summary and explanation of them to this chat by 10PM?,robert z,9/24/13 10:09
FirstGame_Electric_5,Ya I haven't made graphs yet either but it sounded like LiPO had many advantages and I was surprised its RPN was higher than Cadmiums,akash v,9/24/13 10:10
FirstGame_Electric_5,"It isn't the most expensive or the most risky either, but those two factors are traded off with all the batteries.",brandon l,9/24/13 10:10
FirstGame_Electric_5,"It isn't the most expensive or the most risky either, but those two factors are traded off with all the batteries.",brandon l,9/24/13 10:10
FirstGame_PAM_5,"If it's cost per battery/risk, then the Nickel would be the best choice",amalia x,9/24/13 10:10
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,Alright.,mitchell h,9/24/13 10:10
FirstGame_Electric_5,Its more risky because it had the highest RPN,akash v,9/24/13 10:11
FirstGame_PAM_5,"But, seeing as it should be safety as the main priority, I think the Hydrogen would be the best. It creates less harm to the environment as well. The only drawback would be the price but I personally would choose safety and effectiveness over cost.",amalia x,9/24/13 10:11
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,@Nassim Tehrani: Will that work out if we do our graphs by 10pm?,robert z,9/24/13 10:11
FirstGame_Electric_5,"As far as risk and cost, the NiCd seems to be the best. It has medium risk and a low cost. However, its other traits did not impress me.",brandon l,9/24/13 10:12
FirstGame_Electric_5,"As far as risk and cost, the NiCd seems to be the best. It has medium risk and a low cost. However, its other traits did not impress me.",brandon l,9/24/13 10:12
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,I agree the NiCd battery has the best average of the five qualities,joseph h,9/24/13 10:12
FirstGame_Electric_5,@Brandon: Ya I agree with that.,akash v,9/24/13 10:13
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,So as of know we are inputing our graph reflections as we finish by 10pm.  Any objections?,carl b,9/24/13 10:13
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,*now,carl b,9/24/13 10:13
FirstGame_PAM_5,The lithium polymer battery can be compared to the nickel cadmium battery but at the same time it is more safe at reasonable cost.,tiffany x,9/24/13 10:14
FirstGame_Electric_5,I would choose based on lower cost and more reliable and also something that would be convenient for the operator.,akash v,9/24/13 10:16
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,So to clarify we are to have our graphs completed by 10pm but our reflections are postponed?,carl b,9/24/13 10:16
FirstGame_Electric_5,"I would assess the five attributes of the RescuShell. Safety, cost, and recharge interval are affected by the battery. It also adds to the payload, so a heavier battery is less desirable. The recharge interval is mainly associated with the battery, though, so this should be most important.",brandon l,9/24/13 10:17

FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,For power sources the NiCd was obviously the best but the control sensors all even out in the end and just depend on what is the goal of the exoskeleton they are used for,joseph h,9/24/13 10:17
FirstGame_Electric_5,I decided how long the battery can last while maintaining voltage and the cost of the battery as most important,akash v,9/24/13 10:19
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,How can I make my chat window smaller? I need to use both windows if I'm going to complete my graphs.,robert z,9/24/13 10:19
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,I am still constructing the graph. Will give opinion when I am done with it.,amirah u,9/24/13 10:20
FirstGame_Electric_5,The paper said it NiPd was more inefficient but I think according to the graphs in the testing report. It looks that NiPd lasted longer than LiPO,akash v,9/24/13 10:22
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,"For the power source I found the best one would be NiCd. And I found the best one to be either the Piezoelectric or the Strain-Gauge. Both of these are based on the being the most ""even"" graphs.",mitchell h,9/24/13 11:02
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,I agree with Mitchell with the power source.  NiCd offers the best all around support of the three options.  I decided in my opinion that Piezoelectric was the best sensor.  It offers decent middle ground agility and recharge interval but has the benefits of the highest safety rating.  I think this would be worth the higher cost.,robert z,9/24/13 12:33
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,"I would also agree that the NiCd battery should be used. It has the highest payload and agility ratings, plus the safety is still acceptable.  And it's significantly cheaper than the alternatives while the Penzioelectric  control sensor isn't much more than the strain gauge while making up for any safety deficiency.",carl b,9/24/13 20:34
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,I have submitted two notebooks and received emails explaining that they were not what they had wanted and they were very unclear as to how to make it better,joseph k,10/1/13 9:34
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,they mentioned that they wanted the tables to be accurate with their past research so I added the tables that we used to base our graphs yet received a second email explaining that it was still not sufficient,joseph k,10/1/13 9:35
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,I could not figure out how to do that.  I made them in the REDD program but found no way to put them into notebooks so in the notebook I mentioned that I had made them and to see REDD modules,joseph k,10/1/13 9:37
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,@Joseph K: At the top of your notebook page when you are working on it there is a paperclip you can click on which will allow you to attach things such as your graphs.  Its right next to the submit button.  You can also go to your graphing tool and there ,robert z,10/1/13 9:41
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,thanks,joseph k,10/1/13 9:42
FirstGame_Electric_5,"Okay, is there anyway to enlarge the chat?",steven z,10/1/13 9:44
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,Are the team meetings conducted in the chat or as a group in class?,peter h,10/1/13 9:44
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,"Ok, so what is the subject of the meeting?",carl b,10/1/13 9:45
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,Which one should be the ideal choice,joseph h,10/1/13 9:45
FirstGame_Electric_5,Thanks,steven z,10/1/13 9:46
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,I found most of you saying that the NiCd battery was the best choice,joseph k,10/1/13 9:46
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,but I thought that the PFC despite being more expensive would work better for our situation,joseph k,10/1/13 9:46
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,I thought the NiCd battery was the best and the Piezoelectric sensor.,mitchell h,10/1/13 9:46
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,I found the NiCd batteries seemed to be the best choice because they offer good all-around support in the desired fields,robert z,10/1/13 9:46
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,They showed us which sensors/batteries excel in specific areas of interest,cameron k,10/1/13 9:46
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,They showed us which sensors/batteries excel in specific areas of interest,cameron k,10/1/13 9:46
FirstGame_PAM_5,The graphs indicated the advantages and disadvantages of each power source and control sensor.,amalia x,10/1/13 9:47
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,If you really think about it we don't need the sensors and batteries to be the absolute best all around,joseph k,10/1/13 9:47
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,we are using them for search/rescue during disasters correct?,joseph k,10/1/13 9:47
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,Why do you think that,carl b,10/1/13 9:47
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,@Joseph K: Why is that? I agreed with Mitchell about the Piezoelectric,robert z,10/1/13 9:47
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,I found that the combined qualities of the NiCd battery and the piezoelectric sensors seemed best,kevin g,10/1/13 9:47
FirstGame_PAM_5,The graphs enabled us to compare power sources and control sensors given their strengths and weaknesses in relation to the five main attributes.,tiffany x,10/1/13 9:48
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,"I also agree with Mitchel, I think safety and performance are our greatest worries and the NiCd batteries help us do this at the lowest cost",carl b,10/1/13 9:48
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,Yes but why PFC over NiCd?,robert z,10/1/13 9:48
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,Also the graphs and experiments done compared how the batteries/sensors were able to preform under different conditions,fletcher l,10/1/13 9:48
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,I think combined the NiCd and Optic Binary might be the best,joseph h,10/1/13 9:48
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,There was no obvious choice for the sensor,joseph h,10/1/13 9:48
FirstGame_Electric_5,Well i just used evaluations of them as a point system which would determine which has the overall most efficiency and functionability.,steven z,10/1/13 9:49
FirstGame_Electric_5,I recommend the Strain-Gauge Control Sensor,steven z,10/1/13 9:49
FirstGame_PAM_5,The NiCd out preformed the other power sources in 3/5 aspects,amelia n,10/1/13 9:49
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,"I also thought the best power source was the LiPo  battery. Not only did its safety make it a top choice but in addition, it has a much high efficiency than NiCd",peter h,10/1/13 9:49
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,I agree with Joseph. Though I would say almost everyone agrees using NiCd is best but its hard to say for the sensors,amirah u,10/1/13 9:49
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,They all seemed to have at least one area of weakness,cameron k,10/1/13 9:49
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,They all seemed to have at least one area of weakness,cameron k,10/1/13 9:49
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,I agree but the best choice for battery was the NiCd,fletcher l,10/1/13 9:49
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,So it depends on what the overall goal of the individual exoskeleton is,joseph h,10/1/13 9:49
FirstGame_PAM_5,It was obvious that one power source and control were obviously the best choice...but then they both faltered in the area of of cost.,amalia x,10/1/13 9:50
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,we can assume that we dont need a whole ton of agility as they all fail within about 40 degrees per second which is very fast....I looked up how much the payload difference is for each skeleton type and realistically even with the stronger battery we wouldnt be lifting cars,joseph k,10/1/13 9:50
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,the most we can lift with the PFC (ideally) is about 450 lbs,joseph k,10/1/13 9:50
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,Piezoelectric,carl b,10/1/13 9:50
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,@Peter H: I only found the LiPo batteries to be stronger in payload.,robert z,10/1/13 9:50
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,The only reason I do not think that the optic binary sensor is ideal is because of its low safety rating,cameron k,10/1/13 9:50
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,The only reason I do not think that the optic binary sensor is ideal is because of its low safety rating,cameron k,10/1/13 9:50
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,Yeah the optic binary sensor provided ideal cost and recharge interval values but its performance was not the best,fletcher l,10/1/13 9:50
FirstGame_Electric_5,The sensors are nearly identical in value,steven z,10/1/13 9:51
FirstGame_Electric_5,with different strengths and weaknesses to each of them,steven z,10/1/13 9:51
FirstGame_PAM_5,The Strain-Gauge and the Piezoelectric both preformed will in payload but they were more proficient in agility and safety respectively.,amelia n,10/1/13 9:51
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,the other batteries or sensors only add so much more to this payload weight so even if we have the best payload ability we still won't be lifting cars or anything insane like that,joseph k,10/1/13 9:51
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,The Lipo had the lowest safety rating out of all the batteries,carl b,10/1/13 9:51
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,What about the LiPO?,mitchell h,10/1/13 9:51
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,And no one power source or control sensor performed well on every attribute. They all had their strengths and weaknesses.,mitchell h,10/1/13 9:51
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,I also agree with Joseph that the choice for the sensors depends on what the overall goal of the exoskeleton is,fletcher l,10/1/13 9:51
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,The performance of the NiCd would outweigh the weakness of the optic binary,joseph h,10/1/13 9:51
FirstGame_PAM_5,I choose safety and durability over everything else. You want to be able to be dependable if you want to move forward as a company.,amalia x,10/1/13 9:52
FirstGame_PAM_5,"I wouldn't say ""obvious"" because we did have to ration on which attributes were most important, and the component that strongly upheld most of the five attributes....I ended up going with the NiCd  power source and the Strain-Gauge sensor.",tiffany x,10/1/13 9:52
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,"Piezoelectric sensors I think are the sure way to go.  Agility is important for the safety of the operator when in an area which is hazardous.  As for LiPo, I agree with Carl that a low safety rating is not something to be taken lightly and I believe a company or operator would be willing to pay for a much safer piece of equipment",robert z,10/1/13 9:52
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,"My choices are based on which one is more well rounded, though may not excel in every element but it could at least perform the basic elements",amirah u,10/1/13 9:52
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,The more area inside the graph the better the battry/sensor is,joseph h,10/1/13 9:52
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,the safety and recharge interval seemed to be the most important to me as we will need the skeletons to hold up in disaster conditions while being used as long as possible,joseph k,10/1/13 9:53
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,I would also compare the outputs of LiPO and NiCd in the Standard Position Control Sensor graphs.,peter h,10/1/13 9:53
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,"The NiCd performed very well from an all around standpoint, as did the piezoelectric sensor based on the graphs",carl b,10/1/13 9:53
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,Graphs helped show the strong and weak points of each battery.  I chose NiCd because they are pretty average all around and are the most cost efficient.,robert z,10/1/13 9:53
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,"I thought that at times the graph could be a little misleading because if you look at the size alone, you're assuming that each quality is valued equally.",kevin g,10/1/13 9:53
FirstGame_PAM_5,I thought that the payload aspect was paramount so thats what guided me to the NiCd battery,amelia n,10/1/13 9:54
FirstGame_PAM_5,"I prioritized cost, safety, and agility when choosing a power source and control sensor.",tiffany x,10/1/13 9:54
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,It seems we are all in concensus about the Piezoelectric does anyone disagree with that?,joseph k,10/1/13 9:54
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,"I disagree with Joseph, agility would better help deal with or completely avoid hazards in a dangerous environment",carl b,10/1/13 9:54
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,I'm still sticking with the NiCd since it only has one least desirable feature and that's its battery. The other two have three least desirable features.,mitchell h,10/1/13 9:54
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,I would prioritize safety  because this aspect is more important for the user,amirah u,10/1/13 9:54
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,I think safety should definitely be deemed an important attribute since we are dealing with lives of people,cameron k,10/1/13 9:54
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,I think safety should definitely be deemed an important attribute since we are dealing with lives of people,cameron k,10/1/13 9:54
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,I tried to pick a battery that was able to preform well and also had a good safety ranking,fletcher l,10/1/13 9:54
FirstGame_Electric_5,Like I said using the values given can be used as a point system which is essentially the same as the area enclosed by the graph. The most total points indicates the most valuable components,steven z,10/1/13 9:55
FirstGame_PAM_5,The graphs projected the supposed aspects of the battery power and use through the tests done. We could see and pick out each individual batteries strength and weakness through this. I picked the battery that had the best outlook throughout all of the tests.,amalia x,10/1/13 9:55
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,"look at how they measured the agility, the differences between the batteries agility are very minor and only while operating under their maximum payload",joseph k,10/1/13 9:55
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,"I agree with Mitchell, also we need to save costs somewhere, and the NiCd battery is the cheapest",carl b,10/1/13 9:55
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,@Mitchell: That is a good way to look into the graph for the battery.,robert z,10/1/13 9:55
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,I agree safety should always be important in our choice,fletcher l,10/1/13 9:55
FirstGame_Electric_5,I do not think prioritizing is effective because that is opinion.,steven z,10/1/13 9:56
FirstGame_PAM_5,With the graphs I could easily draw conclusions about each type of component given their areas of strengths and weakness.,tiffany x,10/1/13 9:56
FirstGame_PAM_5,@Amalia: Agreed!,tiffany x,10/1/13 9:56
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,"@Carl: That's exactly it if we are going with a more expensive sensor when then need a cheaper battery, while not really sacrificing quality.",mitchell h,10/1/13 9:56
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,@Joseph K: Even disregarding agility NiCd still maintains a better all around battery because the others have specific flaws,robert z,10/1/13 9:56
FirstGame_Electric_5,"It should be based on the statistics, on the other hand when they are equal i also chose safety in the control sensor category",steven z,10/1/13 9:57
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,Does anyone disagree that the Piezoelectric sensor is the best suited,carl b,10/1/13 9:57
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,I would agree.,mitchell h,10/1/13 9:57
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,Are there any major objections to NiCd and Piezoelectric?,robert z,10/1/13 9:57
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,Safety should be important but one aspect of these exoskeletons is to used in life threatening conditions like fires or earthquakes and other such types of scenarios.  At that point the safety of the exoskeleton wont actually be the most important contribution to the safety of the user.  The user is going to need speed and agility or strength,joseph h,10/1/13 9:57
FirstGame_PAM_5,come up with a common aspect that we think makes one power source the particular choice?,amelia n,10/1/13 9:58
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,"I do agree that based on the graphs the NiCd battery is the best choice for the project based on overall cost and efficiency, I think it would also be worth it to test the other batteries in the field as to get a better idea to what we will need",joseph k,10/1/13 9:58
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,Yes I agree as well,peter h,10/1/13 9:58
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,Any objections to NiCd as the Battery?,carl b,10/1/13 9:58
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,I think we can all agree on Piezoelectric,robert z,10/1/13 9:58
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,Agreed with NiCd,robert z,10/1/13 9:58
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,I think  we should decide which battery and control sensor works best for the exoskeleton,amirah u,10/1/13 9:58
FirstGame_Electric_5,Maybe we should make a prototype with our chosen power source and sensors and test it to gain more information about how they work with the exoskeleton in general.,akash v,10/1/13 9:59
FirstGame_Electric_5,"I suppose we should figure out how these components are integrated into the exoskeleton as a whole, although we could possibly research more power sources and sensors.",brandon l,10/1/13 9:59
FirstGame_Electric_5,"I suppose we should figure out how these components are integrated into the exoskeleton as a whole, although we could possibly research more power sources and sensors.",brandon l,10/1/13 9:59
FirstGame_PAM_5,I believe that further research should be conducted and a final selection of the power source and control sensor should be made...,tiffany x,10/1/13 9:59
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,So it seems that our final decision is the Piezoelectric combined with the NiCd?,joseph k,10/1/13 9:59
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,I still do not agree with NiCd because its low efficiency will puts limits on its uses in almost all areas.,peter h,10/1/13 9:59
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,"@Joseph K: No disagreements to more field testing. I'd like to see testing in poor weather conditions like heat, cold, rain, etc.",robert z,10/1/13 9:59
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,I think we can all agree on the NiCd,cameron k,10/1/13 9:59
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,I think we can all agree on the NiCd,cameron k,10/1/13 9:59
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,Well the NiCd seems to be the best battery,fletcher l,10/1/13 9:59
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,Which means we need a prompt for the selection of the sensor,joseph h,10/1/13 9:59
FirstGame_Electric_5,"@Akash: That would be good. We have information about the sensors and power sources individually, but not power sources and sensors working together.",brandon l,10/1/13 10:00
FirstGame_Electric_5,"@Akash: That would be good. We have information about the sensors and power sources individually, but not power sources and sensors working together.",brandon l,10/1/13 10:00
FirstGame_Electric_5,"I would say more specifically research each component to get a more accurate judgement on which is the best, because a five point scale ranking each of the attributes is not very accurate.",steven z,10/1/13 10:00
FirstGame_PAM_5,Select a final battery and sensor to fulfill the requirements of rescue-tek's philosophy in terms of building an exoskeleton.,amalia x,10/1/13 10:00
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,I think it would be cool to run an experiment set up to use the Piezoelectric sensor with the different batteries,joseph k,10/1/13 10:00
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,"I agree to test the other batteries out, but for now I say we just stick with the NiCd and Piezoelectric for now and in the future we can test the other ones.",mitchell h,10/1/13 10:00
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,@Peter H: How is NiCd that low efficient?,robert z,10/1/13 10:00
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,I think the strain gauge works best because it is fairly good on all aspect except the recharge interval,amirah u,10/1/13 10:00
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,Yea I agree with the strain gauge,cameron k,10/1/13 10:00
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,Yea I agree with the strain gauge,cameron k,10/1/13 10:00
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,The piezoelectric sensor was an all around good choice from my data,fletcher l,10/1/13 10:00
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,If we choose the NiCd with the strain gauge look at the overall recharge interval,joseph h,10/1/13 10:00
FirstGame_PAM_5,@Amalia: yes because there must be a preliminary outline for the qualities of a product,amelia n,10/1/13 10:01
FirstGame_PAM_5,Final selection of a power source and control sensor,tiffany x,10/1/13 10:01
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,@Robert: if you do some external research on NiCd batteries you can see that they are quick to burn up and not as reliable as other batteries,joseph k,10/1/13 10:01
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,Agreed,carl b,10/1/13 10:01
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,@Mitchell: Agreed,robert z,10/1/13 10:01
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,Yes the strain-gauge did preform well but the piezoelectric sensor had a better recharge interval and safety ranking,fletcher l,10/1/13 10:01
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,Very bad,joseph h,10/1/13 10:01
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,To get the best overall product we would need to choose a combination of the two that results in the best,joseph h,10/1/13 10:01
FirstGame_Series Elastic_5,NiCd only real weakness is recharge interval so I think that piezoelectric is the way to go,kevin g,10/1/13 10:01
FirstGame_Electric_5,Perhaps assign us to develop a prototype.,akash v,10/1/13 10:02
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,If you notice in the experiments they were all done with  a standard position control sensor powered by the different batteries,joseph k,10/1/13 10:02
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,They do still appear to be the best choice for now,joseph k,10/1/13 10:02
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,"As for reliability, Toyota has used them in the prius since its debut.",carl b,10/1/13 10:02
FirstGame_Electric_5,I just finished the graphs and in my opinion I feel like the Strain Gauge is the best option for the control sensor because it has the overall best average of the main attributes.,alexander b,10/1/13 10:03
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,If I were Vedant I would allow us to run an experiment that allows us a prototype using a piezoelectric sensor and test how the different batteries work with it,joseph k,10/1/13 10:03
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,Something similar to a field test,carl b,10/1/13 10:03
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,I would assign tasks that use the batteries and sensor in experiments.,mitchell h,10/1/13 10:03

FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,I agree with Robert and specifically to use the Piezoelectric which we have already agreed on,joseph k,10/1/13 10:04
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,@Nassim Tehrani: A more in depth study of the benefits of each battery that involves experimenting with each type using the piezoelectric sensor we agreed upon.,peter h,10/1/13 10:04
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,We need to do some sort of testing in the environment in which these exoskeletons will be used,carl b,10/1/13 10:04
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,I think everyone is agreed in field testing of our choices would be our next assignment.,robert z,10/1/13 10:04

FirstGame_PAM_5,Correct,amalia x,10/1/13 10:06
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,"Yes, lets try that, we have already seen articles and data about each but in order to make an informed decision we need to see these batteries performing.",peter h,10/1/13 10:06
FirstGame_PAM_5,Yes,tiffany x,10/1/13 10:07
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,@Carl: I agree that we need to set up those different simulations and also include a control one under normal circumstances,joseph k,10/1/13 10:07

FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,So Nassim what you're saying is we should conduct outside research on our sensor and battery choices?,joseph k,10/1/13 10:10
FirstGame_Pneumatic_4,@Joseph K: I think that would relate more to the control sensor that the power source.,peter h,10/1/13 10:10
FirstGame_Pneumatic_5,I think that would be more of a test for the mechanical shell part of the exoskeleton,carl b,10/1/13 10:10

FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,How did everyone's designs turn out?,peter h,10/8/13 9:41
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,The five designs I created would allow us to test for ROM and Material as variables.,robert z,10/8/13 9:41
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,Similarly to Robert mine test best for seeing how ROM effects the skeleton's performance,joseph k,10/8/13 9:42
FirstGame_Series Elastic_7,I am also waiting for the next task.,amirah u,10/8/13 9:42
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,Okay so I have a question about the design process. Was there any resource describing the 6 different ROM?,peter h,10/8/13 9:43
FirstGame_Electric_9,Alright I just did I believe,alexander b,10/8/13 9:44
FirstGame_Hydraulic_9,Are REDDs shareable in any way or does each of us create the team batch individually?,jordan l,10/8/13 9:44
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,"I think that it is definitely important to test ROM, but it seemed like aluminum was by far the best choice for materials considering its price and density. I think it is most important to test the different ROMs and the LiPO and NiCd Battery.",carl b,10/8/13 9:44
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,"Looking at the variables we're allowed to test we should decide on just one or two to change and see how they effect performance, assuming we only get 5 skeletons we need to limit what we change as much as possible in order to get an understanding on how important they are to the skeleton",joseph k,10/8/13 9:45
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,"For example I used Pneumatics of course and then also used NiCd and Piezoelectric because those were what were best suited for my IC.  That left Material and ROM.  I did one Steel, one Composite, and one Aluminum all will ROM 1 which can compare the material only.  Then I also did two more Steel prototypes but with ROM 3 and ROM 6 to compare the ROMs.",robert z,10/8/13 9:45
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,okay,joseph h,10/8/13 9:45
FirstGame_Electric_9,I think Brandon already did what we were supposed to decide in our meeting but I don't know,akash v,10/8/13 9:46
FirstGame_Hydraulic_9,"Ah, now they are all shared!",jordan l,10/8/13 9:46
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,I think we should do ROM and Battery type,carl b,10/8/13 9:46
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,I agree with Carl,joseph k,10/8/13 9:46
FirstGame_Hydraulic_9,Well we can attach other people's batches into our own notebooks,jimmy i,10/8/13 9:47
FirstGame_Hydraulic_9,"Previous to about 3 minutes ago I was only able to view my own prototypes, but now they are all available to me.",jordan l,10/8/13 9:47
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,We already have data on the batteries though.  I think it would be important to test Materials and ROM,robert z,10/8/13 9:47

FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,"With the Pneumatic Actuator the most effective ROMs to test would be 3, 4, and 5. Since battery life is unaffected until the 4th ROM",carl b,10/8/13 9:48
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,ROM for sure needs to be looked into as it will effect the overall functioning of the skeleton,joseph k,10/8/13 9:48
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,So we agree on ROM,joseph k,10/8/13 9:48
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,any suggestions on what else to check?,joseph k,10/8/13 9:48

FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,We have data on the materials too though. I think that Batteries have more possible flaws that need to be looked in to.,carl b,10/8/13 9:49
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,Yes I don't think any one opposes checking ROM. I think Material would be important to check because we don't have data on it like we do for the other variables(excluding ROM),robert z,10/8/13 9:49
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,All of the prototypes can be seen on the REDD tool I meant how do we start on deciding which to chooce?,joseph h,10/8/13 9:49
FirstGame_Electric_7,Just got one,steven z,10/8/13 9:50
FirstGame_Hydraulic_9,"There are five members of our team, so I think it might be a good idea to first try to explain the top two (subjectively) most important designs to each other, and narrow down the options from there, revising if necessary.  Does this sound good to everyone else?",jordan l,10/8/13 9:50
FirstGame_PAM_9,So shall we begin our discussion of our prototype choices?,tiffany x,10/8/13 9:50
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,Didn't you check Materials Descriptions and Specifications,carl b,10/8/13 9:50
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,Okay never mind I figured it out. I would agree with the testing of ROM and Battery type.,peter h,10/8/13 9:50
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,"But how much do we know the effect of material based on weight, price, and strength?",robert z,10/8/13 9:50
FirstGame_Electric_9,oh ok i got one now,akash v,10/8/13 9:51
FirstGame_Electric_9,I received one,alexander b,10/8/13 9:51
FirstGame_Electric_9,"(I did get the email.) It looks like we all (or almost all) have prototypes for high agility, low price, high reliability/durability/payload/safety, and low energy usage. We also have more balanced preferential prototypes that may be more usable than the extremely focused prototypes.",brandon l,10/8/13 9:51

FirstGame_Hydraulic_9,"Yeah, that's good",jimmy i,10/8/13 9:51
FirstGame_Hydraulic_9,I like that idea,margaret n,10/8/13 9:51
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,"A fair amount, price for sure is a big factor, and the differences in strength weren't incredibly significant",carl b,10/8/13 9:51
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,@Carl: You think the data there is enough to go off of without testing it in the field?,robert z,10/8/13 9:51
FirstGame_Hydraulic_9,@Nassim Tehrani: Are we to just describe our prototypes in the discussion?,jimmy i,10/8/13 9:52
FirstGame_PAM_5,@Justin Kim: Yeah I got it!,luis t,10/8/13 9:52
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,"The biggest variable in the materials was density, but the composite material although the least dense is just way too expensive",carl b,10/8/13 9:52
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,"I agree with Peter, that was the point I was trying to make earlier",carl b,10/8/13 9:52
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,Well and if battery life becomes a big issue we can always revert to composite because of its ultra light weight,peter h,10/8/13 9:52
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,I dont know how valuable it would be to test materials since there just aren't as many variables within a material as there could be in a power source or ROM.,peter h,10/8/13 9:52
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,Alright so then Batteries and ROM?,robert z,10/8/13 9:52
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,I am looking at the balanced design we each made and it looks as though the general consensus is ROM 4 and Piezoelectric,joseph h,10/8/13 9:52
FirstGame_Electric_9,I agree we should have made more balanced prototypes,akash v,10/8/13 9:53
FirstGame_Electric_9,"For high mobility, Akash and I both used Composite, but I chose NiCd while he decided to use LiPO. Of course we have the electric actuator, and the strain-gauge sensor was the best for mobility. ROM 6 is clearly the best motion.",brandon l,10/8/13 9:53

FirstGame_PAM_9,So should we start off by each of saying what their first choice based on their 5 prototypes are?,amalia x,10/8/13 9:53
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,Which would we assume to be our material then? Aluminum seems to be the most logical even though it has the lowest strength.,robert z,10/8/13 9:53
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,yea we all chose composite material for a good portion too,cameron k,10/8/13 9:53
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,yea we all chose composite material for a good portion too,cameron k,10/8/13 9:53
FirstGame_Electric_9,I think Brandon already sent in our batch,akash v,10/8/13 9:54

FirstGame_PAM_9,Well I can only see Tiffany's and mine.,amalia x,10/8/13 9:54
FirstGame_PAM_9,I can only see Amalia and my own prototype designs...,tiffany x,10/8/13 9:54
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,"I agree with aluminum, the differences in strength aren't that significant compared to the differences in price and density.",carl b,10/8/13 9:54
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,"Yes, despite Aluminum's low strength and bigger risk of corrosion I think it is the best choice",joseph k,10/8/13 9:54
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,Is anyone opposed to Aluminum being a set control on all of our prototypes?,joseph k,10/8/13 9:54
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,"Yes, I don't like the idea of using the lowest strength but the steel is just way too heavy and the composite would compromise a reasonable market price.",peter h,10/8/13 9:54
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,"yea I know for the prototype that I tried to balance, the NiCd worked pretty well",cameron k,10/8/13 9:54
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,"yea I know for the prototype that I tried to balance, the NiCd worked pretty well",cameron k,10/8/13 9:54
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,I agree but it seems we different opinions on the battery we all chose,fletcher l,10/8/13 9:54
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,Yeah it looks the same to mean and most of the balanced ones seem to have NiCd,joseph h,10/8/13 9:54
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,three out of four have the NiCd,joseph h,10/8/13 9:54
FirstGame_Electric_9,"No, I sent my five prototypes as a batch to Vedant for the original prototype-making task. That is not our team batch.",brandon l,10/8/13 9:55
FirstGame_Electric_9,"No, I sent my five prototypes as a batch to Vedant for the original prototype-making task. That is not our team batch.",brandon l,10/8/13 9:55
FirstGame_Hydraulic_9,"My two most ""important"" prototypes are my prototypes titled ""Prototype 5 Low-ROM (high recharge interval) variant of 1"" and ""Prototype 1"".  I have several other prototypes built to test maximum abilities in one area, but I believe these two prototypes will be more applicable to all the of the consultants' desires, since they are somewhat ""balanced"".  They do emphasize the qualities DaShawn Edwards was looking for (agility and low RPN) more than other qualities, but I do not think the emphasis is too great to exclude the other consultants' requests.",jordan l,10/8/13 9:55
FirstGame_PAM_5,I was not prompted to create a design,luis t,10/8/13 9:55
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,"Awesome, How about the control sensor?",joseph k,10/8/13 9:55
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,No,peter h,10/8/13 9:55
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,Corrosion could be solved by coating it in something which wouldn't be too expensive.  I agree to use Aluminum.,robert z,10/8/13 9:55
FirstGame_Series Elastic_7,It looks like the series elastic actuator was unanomously used as well,peter s,10/8/13 9:55

FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,We*,joseph h,10/8/13 9:55
FirstGame_Electric_9,@Brandon: Oh i thought that was our team batch. My bad,akash v,10/8/13 9:56
FirstGame_PAM_9,So do we still decide on which 5 to submit? Since it's only two of us is that still possible or valid?,amalia x,10/8/13 9:56
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,"Piezoelectic, it's just the best all around Sensor",carl b,10/8/13 9:56
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,does Piezoelectric sound good to everyone?,joseph k,10/8/13 9:56
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,Piezoelectric seemed to be a favorite from before.,robert z,10/8/13 9:56
FirstGame_Series Elastic_7,oh well i didnt know that. kinda behind,peter s,10/8/13 9:56
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,yea kevin I agree,cameron k,10/8/13 9:56
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,yea kevin I agree,cameron k,10/8/13 9:56
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,sounds good to me,fletcher l,10/8/13 9:56
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,I thought the composite material was the best choice,fletcher l,10/8/13 9:56
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,I think we are going with Composite for the balanced one.,joseph h,10/8/13 9:56
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,So do we have one of those or are we making a new one?,joseph h,10/8/13 9:56
FirstGame_Hydraulic_9,"After viewing the results of my prototypes, my top two are my ""Highest Agility"" one and ""REDD 6"" one. Highest agility uses Aluminum alloy, NiCd battery, Hydraulic actuator, strain gauge sensor, Rom 6. REDD 6 uses Steel, NiCd battery, Hydraulic actuator, Piezoelectric sensor, and Rom 5.",margaret n,10/8/13 9:57
FirstGame_PAM_9,Would it be appropriate to derive our design choice from only one other team member's designs?,tiffany x,10/8/13 9:57
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,"I think the two batteries we should test are the LiPO and the NiCd, the fuel cell is just too expensive",carl b,10/8/13 9:57
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,One of my prototypes was exactly that combo so we dont need to make another I dont think,cameron k,10/8/13 9:57
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,One of my prototypes was exactly that combo so we dont need to make another I dont think,cameron k,10/8/13 9:57
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,Kevins balanced design works for that,joseph h,10/8/13 9:57
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,Yep your two are the same. So next prototype,joseph h,10/8/13 9:57
FirstGame_Electric_7,I actually like your choices although for the last prtotype I would have chosen the Strain-Gauge Sensor,steven z,10/8/13 9:58
FirstGame_Electric_9,"Well for our team batch, I think we should decide on which prototype will be most balanced",akash v,10/8/13 9:58
FirstGame_Electric_9,I like the NiCd power source best,akash v,10/8/13 9:58
FirstGame_Electric_9,"So... LiPO has the highest payload, but NiCd has the highest agility. Recharge interval is a moot point, and NiCd has a better cost and safety. For an agility prototype (if we're going to send one - everyone needs to agree on what we're sending) it seems like NiCd would be better.",brandon l,10/8/13 9:58

FirstGame_Hydraulic_9,"Prototype 1:  I chose NiCd for high agility and average RPN, ROM 4 for decent agility (but not too expensive or power-consuming), aluminum for the light weight and low cost, and piezoelectric control sensors for average agility but low RPN.",jordan l,10/8/13 9:58
FirstGame_PAM_9,Okay I see Amelia's now too...,amalia x,10/8/13 9:58
FirstGame_PAM_9,"But Tiffany, what were your top 3?",amalia x,10/8/13 9:58
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,"Not necessarily, with 5 prototypes the most we could test is 3 with one battery and 2 with another",carl b,10/8/13 9:58
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,No argument there. So we still get to test 4 ROM's,robert z,10/8/13 9:58
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,since there are 5 internal consultant preferences should we have a prototype of best fit for each,cameron k,10/8/13 9:58
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,since there are 5 internal consultant preferences should we have a prototype of best fit for each,cameron k,10/8/13 9:58
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,I think we should make a design that focuses a minimum of two categories not just one,fletcher l,10/8/13 9:58
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,Should it focus on one category?,joseph h,10/8/13 9:58
FirstGame_Electric_9,I agree I think the best power source is NiCd.,alexander b,10/8/13 9:59
FirstGame_Hydraulic_9,"Prototype 5:  It has ROM 3 instead of ROM 4, but is otherwise the same as my first prototype--there were significant reported differences between the two, so I figured it would be interesting to see the difference in the context of the full exoskeleton.",jordan l,10/8/13 9:59
FirstGame_PAM_9,We pretty much had the same designs- PFC and NiCD were our favorites as well as Aluminum and composite materials.,amalia x,10/8/13 9:59
FirstGame_PAM_9,"Your 4th design, my 4th design, and Amelia's 2nd design. Yeah, ours are pretty similar...",tiffany x,10/8/13 9:59
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,"Alright then my suggestion is to make the 5 prototypes all using aluminum, Pneumatic actuator and Piezoelectric ...I agree that ROM 3 to 5 should be tested, 3 will be our closest ROM to control but which battery should be used to test the ROMs?  should we use PFC for one and then NiCd and LiPo for the other two?  this should show us best how the ROMs directly effect performance and Batteries effect performance",joseph k,10/8/13 9:59
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,You need the batteries tested to have the same ROM or else we won't know which variable is affecting our results.,robert z,10/8/13 9:59
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,It also has to meet the other requirements so it cant focus too much on one thing,joseph h,10/8/13 9:59
FirstGame_Electric_7,I vote composite NiCd and Strain-Gauge,steven z,10/8/13 10:00
FirstGame_Electric_7,Becuase it is a balance of low cost and high quality.,steven z,10/8/13 10:00
FirstGame_Electric_9,is the best material and the piezoelectric,akash v,10/8/13 10:00
FirstGame_Electric_9,I think aluminum,akash v,10/8/13 10:00
FirstGame_Electric_9,"We all chose NiCd for the power source of our ""preference"" prototype.",brandon l,10/8/13 10:00
FirstGame_Electric_9,"I personally liked piezoelectric, but more of the internal consultants preferred strain-gauge. So why one or the other?",brandon l,10/8/13 10:00

FirstGame_PAM_9,We also use ROM 3 and 4,tiffany x,10/8/13 10:00
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,"The PFC is too expensive, we should stick to NiCd and LiPO, we only have 5 designs",carl b,10/8/13 10:00
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,So for the battery test it will be ROM 3 using a PFC battery in comparison to ROM 3 using NiCd and LiPo,joseph k,10/8/13 10:00
FirstGame_Series Elastic_7,no,peter s,10/8/13 10:00

FirstGame_Electric_7,And ROM 4,steven z,10/8/13 10:01
FirstGame_Electric_9,we get to choose 5 right? so we should have prototypes with both sensors,akash v,10/8/13 10:01
FirstGame_PAM_9,"Okay. Out of those three, I think my top is Your 4th Design, Amelia's 2nd, and my 4th.",amalia x,10/8/13 10:01
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,"Guys, we only have 5 designs!",carl b,10/8/13 10:01
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,Then for the ROMs we'll use PFC as a control battery so we can see how just the change in ROM effects the skeleton,joseph k,10/8/13 10:01
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,does that make sense?,joseph k,10/8/13 10:01
FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,that is only 5 designs,joseph k,10/8/13 10:01

FirstGame_Pneumatic_9,My suggestion allows for 3 prototypes specifically testing only the ROM completely isolated.,joseph k,10/8/13 10:22
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,I am guessing we wont all really be able to meet again today so should we just split up the prototypes and have each person make a different one?,joseph h,10/8/13 10:22
FirstGame_Electric_7,also did you guys do what the email said? i was a little confused about that part,steven z,10/8/13 10:23
FirstGame_Electric_7,I would say one with composite and one with aluminum,steven z,10/8/13 10:23
FirstGame_Electric_9,I like aluminum the best,akash v,10/8/13 10:23

FirstGame_Hydraulic_9,"Although we had some technical difficulties, we were able to propose our designs and agree upon them",connor f,10/10/13 10:13

FirstGame_Hydraulic_9,I attempted to meet the needs of my internal consultant by suggesting designs that were cost-efficient,connor f,10/10/13 10:14
FirstGame_PAM_9,I used the materials and design elements that worked best with my internal consultants requests,amelia n,10/10/13 10:14

FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,the worker's safety is actually the primary concern when we design the exoskeleton.,amirah u,10/10/13 10:15
FirstGame_Series Elastic_11,Thats why most of the prototypes ended up using the ROM 4,joseph h,10/10/13 10:15
FirstGame_Electric_11,@Justin Kim: I think this because I feel that those three aspects are most relevent when it is operating in the field and I think the rescue worker really only cares if it works when it is supposed to and would probably pay extra money in order to have so,akash v,10/10/13 10:16
FirstGame_Electric_11,Agility allows them to move well to stay safe and get to whoever or whatever they're rescuing. Payload allows them to actually rescue people.,brandon l,10/10/13 10:16

FirstGame_Series Elastic_11,That might just be the case with all Series Elastic actuators though so it might be out of our control,joseph h,10/10/13 10:17
FirstGame_Series Elastic_11,I think the trial gave us a much better idea of the properties of the different parts but I definitely would like to go backand make a few changes,kevin g,10/10/13 10:17
FirstGame_Electric_11,@Brandon: Ya I agree. I think we need to find a way to increase payload for our next tests,akash v,10/10/13 10:18
FirstGame_Series Elastic_9,there was no design that perfectly fits all wanted attributes.,amirah u,10/10/13 10:18

FirstGame_Electric_11,Is it a group poster?,akash v,10/15/13 9:36
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,we decided that the battery and ROM levels were the most pertinent variables and did our best to isolate them as to see how they would directly affect the skeleton's performance,joseph k,10/15/13 9:36
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,That was the best way to use our tests since we could only test five designs.,peter h,10/15/13 9:36
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,We just decided which components of the exoskeleton were more or less the obvious choice for the final product and which ones needed more testing i.e. (the batteries and ROMs),carl b,10/15/13 9:37
FirstGame_Series Elastic_11,which,fletcher l,10/15/13 9:37
FirstGame_Series Elastic_11,So witch is it?,fletcher l,10/15/13 9:37
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,"In reality, I don't know that they factored in much. A lot of them wanted a lot of different things and we were trying to keep as many variables constant as possible",carl b,10/15/13 9:38
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,Most wanted a high payload and safety standards so we factored what different elements would give us the best outcome to meet those standards.,mitchell h,10/15/13 9:38
FirstGame_Series Elastic_11,Thanks,fletcher l,10/15/13 9:38
FirstGame_Series Elastic_11,Okay.,joseph h,10/15/13 9:38
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,For the variables that we tried to control (the ones we kept the same from prototype to prototype) we did our best to choose the best features that would hopefully fit their standards,joseph k,10/15/13 9:39
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,"Yes, for example the choice of aluminum as Robert just mentioned",joseph k,10/15/13 9:39
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,The IC requests made us aware of what sort of attributes are important to the exoskeleton.  Cost was one that got us deciding on using aluminum for our frame for example.,robert z,10/15/13 9:39
FirstGame_Electric_11,@Justin Kim: So we get assigned a new group sometime soon?,akash v,10/15/13 9:40
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,"I would say that was our primary interest, as they are the ones who will use the exoskeletons",carl b,10/15/13 9:40
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,"Yes, I think they just gave us certain areas to focus on that we may not have considered otherwise.",peter h,10/15/13 9:40
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,"I agree, the consultants that specifically mentioned the buyers and users of the skeletons were most important such as the marketing or design consultants",joseph k,10/15/13 9:41
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,Because of them our safety and agility are higher quality.,mitchell h,10/15/13 9:41
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,The only impact their interest had was minimizing the cost of the exoskeleton to accommodate their price restraints,peter h,10/15/13 9:41
FirstGame_Series Elastic_11,is there an outline or instructions on what this final presentation is?,cameron k,10/15/13 9:41
FirstGame_Series Elastic_11,is there an outline or instructions on what this final presentation is?,cameron k,10/15/13 9:41
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,We used components like the Piezoelectric Sensor which had a high safety rating but also good all around attributes,carl b,10/15/13 9:42
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,"Most wanted a cheaper, safer and faster equipment",joseph k,10/15/13 9:42
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,I think the rescue workers' safety was important.  We chose variables which allowed for the best agility or payload for example which did not compromise safety rating for it.,robert z,10/15/13 9:42
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,I would say it was we got many different results and it gives us insight on which factors matter the most.,mitchell h,10/15/13 9:43
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,"Yes, several of the exoskeletons fit within the specifications of all the consultants",carl b,10/15/13 9:44
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,"yes, it seems that our first ""control"" skeleton would have been the best choice, excelling in almost all areas except payload",joseph k,10/15/13 9:44
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,"What I noticed is that the increase in ROM produced better payload and agility but significantly set back the other performance features. The change in battery from NiCd to LiPo allowed for a much higher payload for about 60 dollars less and gave us maybe 24 minutes of extra use before needing a recharge. It also caused us to lose agility and safety but only so much that it was no longer ideal. It still met all minimum standards of the consultants. This leads me to think that our best route is to ideally forget about higher ROMs, even 4 was putting unnecessary constraints on our prototypes. At the same time we should not completely disregard the LiPO battery option as tweaking other features may prove that this is in fact a better battery choice.",joseph k,10/15/13 9:44
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,The trial was certainly successful for the variables we tested however I think that if we had been able to test our personal batches we could have likely created a more refined exoskeleton.,peter h,10/15/13 9:44
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,Naturally we wont find a perfect exoskeleton which will fill all our requirements and desires but the tests gave us back useful information which I would say were the results of a successful trial.,robert z,10/15/13 9:44
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,"Yes, I agree that was the main one",carl b,10/15/13 9:45
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,The limitations in how many designs we could test.,peter h,10/15/13 9:45
FirstGame_Series Elastic_11,"So with this new group, is the exoskeleton that we are picking being decided once we get there or is it based on the decisions from this group?",joseph h,10/15/13 9:45
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,"Yes, realizing that it would be expensive or time consuming to the company to test a multitude of skeletons, it made sense that we had to limit our prototypes but it put serious constraints on what we could specifically look at",joseph k,10/15/13 9:46
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,Knowledge on how certain variables effect the pneumatic actuator,carl b,10/15/13 9:47
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,We will be able to identify variables we want to test from earlier on. This will help us create tests that will maximize the variables we can analyze.,peter h,10/15/13 9:47
FirstGame_Series Elastic_11,"Okay, and this is due at the end of thursdays class?",joseph h,10/15/13 9:47
FirstGame_PAM_9,okay I just got it!,luis t,10/15/13 9:48
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,We will bring our data specifically with our Pneumatics and all the effects with it and other variables on our exoskeletons to compare with other actuators and their data.,robert z,10/15/13 9:48
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,The Pneumatic actuator works well with the NiCd battery and piezoelectric control system.  It has approvable safety ratings and seems to lack only in payload and agility which is most likely caused by its inability to utilize higher ROM levels,joseph k,10/15/13 9:49
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,"I agree with Robert, but they also may be inferior to others in terms of payload and agility.",mitchell h,10/15/13 9:50
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,Our pneumatic actuators are very efficient and cost effective.,robert z,10/15/13 9:50

FirstGame_Electric_11,Hey my presentation resources do not work/open,steven z,10/15/13 9:51
FirstGame_PAM_9,@Justin Kim: Should I create a batch for the designs even though a batch has already been made?,luis t,10/15/13 9:51
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,The use of Gas in the actuator as opposed to water makes for a more reliable and efficient use of energy and the Pneumatic design is safer than the artificial muscle outline which severely limits its payload abilities as the muscles are less supportive than the steel or aluminum piping used in our actuator,joseph k,10/15/13 9:51
FirstGame_Electric_11,the whole page seems its about to like crash again,steven z,10/15/13 9:52
FirstGame_Pneumatic_11,"Yes, that pretty much sums it up",carl b,10/15/13 9:52

FirstGame_2_12,The series elastic actuators were really good with agility and with safety but the recharge interval was not very good and the cost and payload were average at best,joseph h,10/17/13 9:37
FirstGame_3_12,"PAM(Pneumatic)s, weakness was that it had a limited max force and power output due to its flexible structure, so agility and payload were low. Its strength was that it was lightweight, cheap to produce, and had high recharge intervals.",amalia x,10/17/13 9:37
FirstGame_3_12,It was also very affordable,carl b,10/17/13 9:37
FirstGame_5_12,"Series Elastic Actuators are electric actuators with an elastic element that makes them much safer. However, this elastic system makes them very expensive with a very short recharge interval.",kevin g,10/17/13 9:37
FirstGame_1_12,yes i am. and i already posted in the chat that i previously worked with series elastic team.,amirah u,10/17/13 9:38
FirstGame_3_12,So with the series elastic actuator agility is maximized but payload was usually weaker. Also because of the actuators rapid acceleration it is hard to meet the recharge interval in a design,fletcher l,10/17/13 9:38
FirstGame_4_12,@Tiffany: What does being lightweight do to the technical specifications?  Is that good for payload?,jordan l,10/17/13 9:38
FirstGame_5_12,I think our best plan of action is to test a batch that allows us to view at least two different actuators (our two best choices that we will decide now) and also how a change in battery or other variable will effect these skeletons,joseph k,10/17/13 9:38

FirstGame_1_12,"I worked with the Pneumatic Actuator.  For a quick review, its strengths lie in that it is energy-efficient and cost-effective because it only uses pressurized air.  However, due to that use of pressurized air, it lacks in its agility and payload capacity.",robert z,10/17/13 9:39
FirstGame_2_12,Peter what do you mean exactly by efficient?,joseph h,10/17/13 9:39
FirstGame_2_12,The pneumatic actuator is very efficient and has a very reasonable cost. It has average payload capacity and above average agility especially in the higher ROM,peter h,10/17/13 9:39
FirstGame_4_12,"@Jordan: Yes, the payload was reasonably high",tiffany x,10/17/13 9:39

FirstGame_5_12,Nope.  The only requirement series elastic was good for was safety.,kevin g,10/17/13 9:39
FirstGame_1_12,Ok I had the electric actuator and we kept what we found was as ROM went up the agility and payload went up but the recharge interval went down. All the prototypes we designed were good however I think it need to increase payload and recharge interval and lower cost. I would say the electric actuator is good for agility and safety.,akash v,10/17/13 9:40

FirstGame_2_12,Which ROM did you all use most often? I used 4.,joseph h,10/17/13 9:58
FirstGame_2_12,Will we each be making the batch or should one intern create them for the rest to attach to their notebook?,peter h,10/17/13 9:58
FirstGame_2_12,between 5.9 and 7.4 but 7 is obviously more preferrable,steven z,10/17/13 9:58
FirstGame_3_12,I'm pretty sure it would....all our prototypes had really low payloads (about 496 and below) but really high recharges (6.5 +),amalia x,10/17/13 9:58
FirstGame_5_12,Likewise,connor f,10/17/13 9:58
FirstGame_5_12,"Yes, my group also liked the NiCd battery best although the LiPO battery has the ability to make up for a low payload should we need that option",joseph k,10/17/13 9:58

FirstGame_1_12,What about sensor?,robert z,10/17/13 10:00
FirstGame_1_12,Actuators might need to be one of our main variables.  I found piezoelectric sensors to be best.,robert z,10/17/13 10:00

FirstGame_4_12,"I don't think ROM needs to be shared, since that is overall dependent on the actuator after the control sensor and power source were balanced.",jordan l,10/17/13 10:00
FirstGame_4_12,Ok cool. So what does everyone think our finally should look like? I'm guessing the Actuator and Material are going to be the two most debated.,mitchell h,10/17/13 10:00
FirstGame_5_12,"My group tested strictly Piezoelectric, did anyone isolate the control sensor and see what that directly did to the features?",joseph k,10/17/13 10:00

FirstGame_5_12,I liked the piezoelectric sensor but it is also the most expensive,luis t,10/17/13 10:00
FirstGame_1_12,I thought so too but strain gauge wasn't bad either but i felt piezoelectric was best,akash v,10/17/13 10:01

FirstGame_5_14,I liked that our prototypes were all low cost,connor f,10/22/13 10:20
FirstGame_2_12,Overall I think it is definitely the best option. I am confident with this decision and just add our other thoughts and adjustments in the presentation.,steven z,10/22/13 10:21
FirstGame_5_14,"the marketing allows for 15,020 at max and even our most expensive using best material and control sensor did not come close to this mark",joseph k,10/22/13 10:21

FirstGame_5_14,What did our consultants say about payloads?,connor f,10/22/13 10:23
FirstGame_5_14,528 is min payload,joseph k,10/22/13 10:23
FirstGame_5_14,I like those numbers,kevin g,10/22/13 10:23
FirstGame_5_14,We can get that with the hydraulic system,connor f,10/22/13 10:24

FirstGame_5_14,"from what I can figure out the difference between the lifting force of 528N and 480N is roughly 11 pounds.

SecondGame_PAM_5,yeah,cameron i,11/7/13 10:14

SecondGame_PAM_5,yes,cormick u,11/7/13 10:14
SecondGame_PAM_5,The piezoelectric was the best sensor in my opinion.,keegan q,11/7/13 10:14

SecondGame_PAM_5,What did you guys think for the control sensors?,nicholas l,11/7/13 10:14
SecondGame_PAM_5,we will have to see once we get more information,cormick u,11/7/13 10:16
SecondGame_PAM_5,to early to make a call i think,cormick u,11/7/13 10:16
SecondGame_PAM_5,I thought piezoelectric,daniel t,11/7/13 10:16
SecondGame_PAM_5,"For the safety i think piezoelectric is obvious but it is the most expensive, so do you guys think it's worth the price?",nicholas l,11/7/13 10:16

SecondGame_PAM_9,sure,cameron i,11/19/13 9:30

SecondGame_PAM_9,"No, we should decide collectively I think",keegan q,11/19/13 9:30
SecondGame_PAM_9,I suppose so,nicholas l,11/19/13 9:30
SecondGame_PAM_9,We could i suppose,nicholas l,11/19/13 9:30

SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,Good morning everyone!,christina b,11/19/13 9:30
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,Yeah I think the NiCd battery is the best choice for most combinations so lets use that for at least a few,casey f,11/19/13 9:31
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,we should try to think of designs that isolate certain aspects,jackson p,11/19/13 9:31

SecondGame_PAM_9,like how that one change affected the different,cormick u,11/19/13 9:31
SecondGame_PAM_9,I think we should at least pick two similar ones with like one major difference and see how they compare,cormick u,11/19/13 9:31
SecondGame_PAM_9,I mean i think it is clear we all like the NiCd battery,nicholas l,11/19/13 9:31
SecondGame_PAM_9,How about the material should we try one of each?,nicholas l,11/19/13 9:31

SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,Thats a good idea,casey f,11/19/13 9:32
SecondGame_PAM_9,Yes but it doesn't hurt to try a different one if we can,cameron i,11/19/13 9:32

SecondGame_PAM_9,yeah i understand,nicholas l,11/19/13 9:32
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,"I agree, the NiCd seemed like the best power source",nicholas n,11/19/13 9:32
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,"I think it would be good to start off testing one device with a NiCd power source, a Piezoelectric control sensor, and an aluminum material and another with NiCd and Piezoelectric with a steel or composite material.

SecondGame_Electric_9,Were there any batteries that stood out to anybody? I used PFC and NiCd in my initial batch,justin y,11/19/13 9:33
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,I agree with Jackson.  Everyone for the most part only used the NiCd power source. I also think we should solely use ROM 4 in order to isolate the material and sensor which had the most variation among prototypes.,brandon f,11/19/13 9:33

SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,We have to remember that the higher the ROM the more we kill the battery,derek v,11/19/13 9:33
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,That sounds good to me.,nicholas n,11/19/13 9:33
SecondGame_Electric_9,"I found composite to be the best, but it was also the most expensive, and the other one I used was the aluminum material",justin y,11/19/13 9:34
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,"I agree. Using the NiCd battery and ROM 4, lets first come up with a prototype to maximize agility and Payload",casey f,11/19/13 9:34
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,Then maybe create another with better recharge interval?,casey f,11/19/13 9:34
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,"well with NiCd, and ROM 4, the first 3 prototypes can use the same sensor, and each a different material",jackson p,11/19/13 9:34
SecondGame_PAM_9,those are two similar devices that we could test how the material affects it,cormick u,11/19/13 9:34
SecondGame_PAM_9,"Al, Pie, NiCd, Pam, ROM5 Steel, Pie, NiCd, PAM, ROM5",cormick u,11/19/13 9:34
SecondGame_PAM_9,do we have those devices?,cormick u,11/19/13 9:34
SecondGame_PAM_9,The highest roms are good for the payload and agility but they totally kill the battery,keegan q,11/19/13 9:34
SecondGame_PAM_9,Yeah buy i feel like if we decrease the ROM to something with a significant battery increase that the agility and payload are worthless,nicholas l,11/19/13 9:34
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,Yeah we should test a rom 2 or 1,christina b,11/19/13 9:34
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,Should we test a couple with the NiCd and piezoelectric?,nicholas n,11/19/13 9:34
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,"I would agree with that. Then looking at our results we had a variety of ROM, our test results should be a variety also.",abigail z,11/19/13 9:34
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,I think we should at least try a ROM of 4 and 5,nathan d,11/19/13 9:34
SecondGame_Electric_9,I used NiCd and LiPO.,brent p,11/19/13 9:35
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,then the last two prototypes we could use steel and the other two sensors,jackson p,11/19/13 9:35
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,"id say all 3 materials should be used at least once, with maybe steel used again",shane t,11/19/13 9:35
SecondGame_PAM_9,So we should go with a high rom and then pick like optic binary to make up for that,cameron i,11/19/13 9:35
SecondGame_PAM_9,So we should go with a high rom and then pick like optic binary to make up for that,cameron i,11/19/13 9:35
SecondGame_PAM_9,then just decrease it to 5 and not 1,cormick u,11/19/13 9:35
SecondGame_PAM_9,there has got to be some compromise in the machine,cormick u,11/19/13 9:35
SecondGame_PAM_9,agreed,cormick u,11/19/13 9:35
SecondGame_PAM_9,but not buy,nicholas l,11/19/13 9:35
SecondGame_PAM_9,We could do that,nicholas l,11/19/13 9:35
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,Yes that is good,christina b,11/19/13 9:35
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,"Yes, I think the second should be the same as that one with a ROM of 3 instead",derek v,11/19/13 9:35
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,I think that will be a good one to test,nicholas n,11/19/13 9:35
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,We should probably tr a low ROM and a High ROM because the high ROM will give us low recharge interval,luke u,11/19/13 9:35
SecondGame_Electric_9,@Brent: Did you use NiCd more or LiPO?,justin y,11/19/13 9:36
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,Yeah that sounds good. That way we can compare the effects of a sensor and the effects of the materials on the device,casey f,11/19/13 9:36
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,How do we know what the different effects of different ROMs are?,samuel o,11/19/13 9:36
SecondGame_PAM_9,ya its just not as safe as the others so we have to be careful to keep the risk number low,cormick u,11/19/13 9:36
SecondGame_PAM_9,Yeah i like the optic binary especially for cost,nicholas l,11/19/13 9:36
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,"I can make the batch. Should our first design be Aluminum, NiCd, Piezelectric, and ROM 4?",abigail z,11/19/13 9:36
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,maybe try the two that i mentioned one with an ROM of 3 and one with 5? I think because the devices have a lot of similar features it will also allow us to compare the ROM in addition to the material,caitlyn y,11/19/13 9:36
SecondGame_Electric_9,"I used more LiPO, but at a second look I think NiCd is a the better of the two",brent p,11/19/13 9:37
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,@Samuel: It was an article in resources,brandon f,11/19/13 9:37
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,@Samuel: It was an article in resources,brandon f,11/19/13 9:37
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,there are graphs on one of the resource pages. Everything is optimized around ROM 4,jackson p,11/19/13 9:37
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,but i would be open for possibly changing one or two prototypes to a different ROM,jackson p,11/19/13 9:37
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,I saw the 3 graphs in the resources section,shane t,11/19/13 9:37
SecondGame_PAM_9,yeah so we could match it up with NiCd,cameron i,11/19/13 9:37
SecondGame_PAM_9,yeah so we could match it up with NiCd,cameron i,11/19/13 9:37
SecondGame_PAM_9,so lets start picking some:,cormick u,11/19/13 9:37
SecondGame_PAM_9,narrow our choices down,cormick u,11/19/13 9:37
SecondGame_PAM_9,Just because the payload and agility aren't at their max doesn't mean they're worthless,keegan q,11/19/13 9:37
SecondGame_PAM_9,Yeah which is why im wondering  how much safety is affected by the material,nicholas l,11/19/13 9:37
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,would we keep everything else the same?,nicholas n,11/19/13 9:37
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,Ok I'll get started.,abigail z,11/19/13 9:37
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,Or with a ROM or 3 or 5 then?,abigail z,11/19/13 9:37
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,Should we try one with optic binary?,caitlyn y,11/19/13 9:37
SecondGame_Electric_9,"Yea, I found NiCd to be the better of my two also.",justin y,11/19/13 9:38
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,The only other ROM I would try is 5 but I don't think the increased payload is worth the recharge interval decrease.,brandon f,11/19/13 9:38
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,The only other ROM I would try is 5 but I don't think the increased payload is worth the recharge interval decrease.,brandon f,11/19/13 9:38
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,Yeah plus we will make another batch with our new groups. Once we know the effects of other aspects we can then mess around with the ROM,casey f,11/19/13 9:38
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,I agree with Brandon on that point,jackson p,11/19/13 9:38
SecondGame_PAM_9,those two can determine if the rom is worth dropping or no if we want,cormick u,11/19/13 9:38
SecondGame_PAM_9,"Al, Pie, NiCd, Pam, ROM5",cormick u,11/19/13 9:38
SecondGame_PAM_9,"Al,PE,NiCd,PAM,ROM 6",cormick u,11/19/13 9:38
SecondGame_PAM_9,we want to try all the materials correct?,nicholas l,11/19/13 9:38
SecondGame_PAM_9,definitely,nicholas l,11/19/13 9:38
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,we could try 3,christina b,11/19/13 9:38
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,It's hard because the difference in the battery charge between ROM 3 and ROM 4 are so different,derek v,11/19/13 9:38
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,I agree with 3,derek v,11/19/13 9:38
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,i think around 3 because its right in the middle,nicholas n,11/19/13 9:38
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,"Ok, so maybe something like NiCd, optic binary, Composite, ROM 5?",caitlyn y,11/19/13 9:38
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,Yeah i think that might be a good idea,luke u,11/19/13 9:38
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,I think it would be worth it to try,nathan d,11/19/13 9:38
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,"so what if the first three each are the same (NiCd, optic binary, ROM4) and each have a different material",jackson p,11/19/13 9:39
SecondGame_PAM_9,"ok and then maybe a al, SG, NiCd, ROM6 PAM",cameron i,11/19/13 9:39
SecondGame_PAM_9,"ok and then maybe a al, SG, NiCd, ROM6 PAM",cameron i,11/19/13 9:39
SecondGame_PAM_9,"alright, who is gonna piece them all together?",cormick u,11/19/13 9:39
SecondGame_PAM_9,ROM5 gives you the same payload as rom6 and it decreases the battery more,keegan q,11/19/13 9:39
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,I agree,christina b,11/19/13 9:39
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,I think optic binary is the next best option,nicholas n,11/19/13 9:39
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,ok that sounds good,caitlyn y,11/19/13 9:39
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,"Yeah i agree with Nathan, it increases the payload more",luke u,11/19/13 9:39
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,I liked optic binary with LiPO,nathan d,11/19/13 9:39
SecondGame_Electric_9,"So, should we have at least 2 prototypes with NiCd and at least 1 of each of the other two? Or does anybody want to elimnate one of the other two?",justin y,11/19/13 9:40
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,I think we should use the strain-gauge and piezoelectric sensors.,brandon f,11/19/13 9:40
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,I think we should use the strain-gauge and piezoelectric sensors.,brandon f,11/19/13 9:40
SecondGame_PAM_9,we haven't,cameron i,11/19/13 9:40
SecondGame_PAM_9,we haven't,cameron i,11/19/13 9:40
SecondGame_PAM_9,When did we decide?,keegan q,11/19/13 9:40
SecondGame_PAM_9,"We should probably do one with like S,OB,NiCd,PAM,ROM 6",nicholas l,11/19/13 9:40
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,I was thinking PFC also,christina b,11/19/13 9:40
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,PFC,derek v,11/19/13 9:40
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,If we do PFC and Optic Binary it should maximize the battery charge,derek v,11/19/13 9:40
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,"Ok so composite, LiPO, optic binary, ROM 5?",abigail z,11/19/13 9:40
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,sounds good,caitlyn y,11/19/13 9:40
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,yea sure,nathan d,11/19/13 9:40
SecondGame_Electric_9,What do we think is more important; the payload or the safety?,brent p,11/19/13 9:41
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,and then try with the other sensors and using ROM5 and ROM3 for the next two?,shane t,11/19/13 9:41
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,Whichever sensor has the lower recharge interval can use ROM3,shane t,11/19/13 9:41
SecondGame_PAM_9,"do we want to go with composite or steel with that? Steel will have bad agility, but composite will be pricey",cameron i,11/19/13 9:41
SecondGame_PAM_9,"do we want to go with composite or steel with that? Steel will have bad agility, but composite will be pricey",cameron i,11/19/13 9:41
SecondGame_PAM_9,how much does that help the battery/ hurt the payload and agility?,cormick u,11/19/13 9:41
SecondGame_PAM_9,i say composite,cormick u,11/19/13 9:41
SecondGame_PAM_9,What about like ROM4?,keegan q,11/19/13 9:41
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,Steel,derek v,11/19/13 9:41
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,What power source do we want to test it with,caitlyn y,11/19/13 9:41
SecondGame_Electric_9,"I feel like they are both very important, safety for the person using it, and payload to be able to lift bigger objects in a dangerous situation",justin y,11/19/13 9:42
SecondGame_Electric_9,"I think that the safety is more important, but we want to have at least an average payload; if the payload is not up to standard that would not be good.",madeline g,11/19/13 9:42
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,Does everyone think steel is the best material to use?,brandon f,11/19/13 9:42
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,Does everyone think steel is the best material to use?,brandon f,11/19/13 9:42
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,Yeah,casey f,11/19/13 9:42
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,im not sure but i would be ok to test it as if it was,jackson p,11/19/13 9:42
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,"i think that would be good, would we want to use steel for the other two",jackson p,11/19/13 9:42
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,Yes,samuel o,11/19/13 9:42
SecondGame_PAM_9,this is true,cameron i,11/19/13 9:42
SecondGame_PAM_9,this is true,cameron i,11/19/13 9:42
SecondGame_PAM_9,agreed,cormick u,11/19/13 9:42
SecondGame_PAM_9,its just a prototype,cormick u,11/19/13 9:42
SecondGame_PAM_9,i say composite we already using the cheap battery,daniel t,11/19/13 9:42
SecondGame_PAM_9,Yeah i feel like composite might be really nice despite the high cost,nicholas l,11/19/13 9:42
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,we haven't done steel yet?,abigail z,11/19/13 9:42
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,oh for power source we also haven't done PFC yet,abigail z,11/19/13 9:42
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,PFC? to make up for the low recharge interval,nathan d,11/19/13 9:42
SecondGame_Electric_9,"alright should we test two with the PFC, two with the NiCd, and one LiPO?",brent p,11/19/13 9:43
SecondGame_Electric_9,"@Brent: yea, i was thinking the same thing",justin y,11/19/13 9:43
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,Do you think the high density will decrease the agility?,brandon f,11/19/13 9:43
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,Do you think the high density will decrease the agility?,brandon f,11/19/13 9:43
SecondGame_PAM_9,yup,cormick u,11/19/13 9:43
SecondGame_PAM_9,Oh duh,keegan q,11/19/13 9:43
SecondGame_PAM_9,Wait what battery are we using?,keegan q,11/19/13 9:43
SecondGame_PAM_9,I think we all like the NiCd,nicholas l,11/19/13 9:43
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,PFC steel strain gauge ROM 5 or 6?,caitlyn y,11/19/13 9:43
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,yeah I think 5,luke u,11/19/13 9:43
SecondGame_Electric_9,@Madeline: Do you agree?,justin y,11/19/13 9:44
SecondGame_Electric_9,I agree,madeline g,11/19/13 9:44
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,we can make new prototypes,jackson p,11/19/13 9:44
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,@Justin Kim: we can only use existing prototypes for the batch right?,shane t,11/19/13 9:44
SecondGame_PAM_9,ok so do we have one?,cameron i,11/19/13 9:44
SecondGame_PAM_9,ok so do we have one?,cameron i,11/19/13 9:44
SecondGame_PAM_9,I think you guys should bring up the resource for the ROMs.,keegan q,11/19/13 9:44
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,"yeah I agree, I'll make that one if everyone agrees.",abigail z,11/19/13 9:44
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,sure,caitlyn y,11/19/13 9:44
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,I think our last one should also be with steel,caitlyn y,11/19/13 9:44
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,sounds good,nathan d,11/19/13 9:44
SecondGame_Electric_9,"Cool, so which sensors were the best for everybody? I found Optic Binary and Piezoelectric to be the best ones for my consultant",justin y,11/19/13 9:45
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,I can make the batch,brandon f,11/19/13 9:45
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,So is this good?,brandon f,11/19/13 9:45
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,disregard that last post,brandon f,11/19/13 9:45

SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,disregard that last post,brandon f,11/19/13 9:45
SecondGame_PAM_9,so how many devices do we have now?,cormick u,11/19/13 9:45
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,Yeah I think we should do a middle rom,christina b,11/19/13 9:45
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,I think that middle ROM will produce better results,nicholas n,11/19/13 9:45
SecondGame_Electric_9,Yeah I agree,brent p,11/19/13 9:46
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,"1. stainless steel, strain-gauge",brandon f,11/19/13 9:46

SecondGame_PAM_9,"ROM is a tough choice, because where one is good its bad on another graph",cameron i,11/19/13 9:46
SecondGame_PAM_9,ya well how do we decide what is more important?,cormick u,11/19/13 9:46
SecondGame_PAM_9,The problem with the ROM of 5 or 6 is the recharge interval is poor,daniel t,11/19/13 9:46
SecondGame_PAM_9,I think the payload takes to much of a dip for the increase in the battery interbal,nicholas l,11/19/13 9:46
SecondGame_PAM_9,at rom 5 we can say it is approx 3 and at rom 4 it is about 4.5,nicholas l,11/19/13 9:46
SecondGame_PAM_9,Well I think where we do bad in ROM we should make up with other factors,cameron i,11/19/13 9:47
SecondGame_PAM_9,Well I think where we do bad in ROM we should make up with other factors,cameron i,11/19/13 9:47
SecondGame_PAM_9,ya i think ROM5 is a good choice,cormick u,11/19/13 9:47
SecondGame_PAM_9,ROM 5,daniel t,11/19/13 9:47
SecondGame_PAM_9,Well at least we could use rom5 because that doesn't even increase the agility and there is some battery left,keegan q,11/19/13 9:47
SecondGame_PAM_9,so an hour and half increase for about 1000 n drop in payload,nicholas l,11/19/13 9:47
SecondGame_PAM_9,yeah i agree with ROM 5,nicholas l,11/19/13 9:47
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,I can make the batch unless someone already made it,nicholas n,11/19/13 9:47
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,Maybe with the piezeolectric control sensor?,abigail z,11/19/13 9:47
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,Is there anything else anyone else thinks we should be testing?,caitlyn y,11/19/13 9:47

SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,That sounds good to me.,abigail z,11/19/13 9:48
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,That's a good idea. ROM 5 again?,caitlyn y,11/19/13 9:48

SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,the third?,nicholas n,11/19/13 9:49
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,Cool I think we all agree,luke u,11/19/13 9:49
SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,I think that would be a good design with ROM 5,nathan d,11/19/13 9:49
SecondGame_Electric_9,Yeah that's great idea,brent p,11/19/13 9:50
SecondGame_Electric_9,And for the LiPO I feel Piezoelectric would be best because LiPO has a bad safety rating,justin y,11/19/13 9:50

SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,"Ya i agree, optic binary",shane t,11/19/13 9:50
SecondGame_PAM_9,And maybe try like rom4 if we have room,keegan q,11/19/13 9:50
SecondGame_PAM_9,so we are not testing that at all then?,nicholas l,11/19/13 9:50

SecondGame_Series Elastic_9,Thanks!,luke u,11/19/13 9:51
SecondGame_Electric_9,"Ok, next is material, I found composite to be the best, however also the most expensive, otherwise I used aluminum for my other prototypes, what about you guys?",justin y,11/19/13 9:52
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,Yeah I say piezoelectric for the first three,casey f,11/19/13 9:52
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,im good with that,jackson p,11/19/13 9:52
SecondGame_PAM_9,i thought we already did,cormick u,11/19/13 9:52
SecondGame_PAM_9,So should we discuss materials?,keegan q,11/19/13 9:52
SecondGame_PAM_9,yeaht that would be interesting,nicholas l,11/19/13 9:52
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,"Yea, thanks.",nicholas n,11/19/13 9:52
SecondGame_Pneumatic_9,"Ok everyone, i made a batch with all 5 prototypes",nicholas n,11/19/13 9:52
SecondGame_Electric_9,"I tested steel as well.  It is a little more expensive, but it has a better tensile strength than the aluminum",brent p,11/19/13 9:53
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,"okay, sounds good. So the first three will have ROM 4, piezoelectric, and use each of the materials, right?",brandon f,11/19/13 9:53
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,Are we using steel for the last two?,brandon f,11/19/13 9:53

SecondGame_PAM_9,I feel if Alum was paired with NiCd and Piezoelectric and Strain Gauge it will be interesting,cameron i,11/19/13 9:54
SecondGame_PAM_9,We have 3 variables that we've decided on. I think we should pick the best two of each materials and control sensor and test the two of those. Then we could maybe try one with a lower rom,keegan q,11/19/13 9:54
SecondGame_Electric_9,"Okay, I feel for the design with NiCd and Optic Binary should use either aluminum or steel because it is already using the most expensive battery and sensor",justin y,11/19/13 9:55
SecondGame_Electric_9,and preference?,justin y,11/19/13 9:55

SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,sounds good,casey f,11/19/13 9:55
SecondGame_Electric_9,and for the PFC and Piezoelectric we could use composite because it is using the cheapest other stuff,justin y,11/19/13 9:56
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,"nevermind,. 5 was supposed to use strain gauge",brandon f,11/19/13 9:56
SecondGame_Hydraulic_9,Everyone agree with those choices?,brandon f,11/19/13 9:56

SecondGame_Electric_9,okay,justin y,11/19/13 10:01
SecondGame_Electric_9,Does anyone have  preference for the material used on the other prototypes?,justin y,11/19/13 10:01
SecondGame_Electric_9,We should use aluminum with the NiCd piezoelectric as well; it will even out the high cost of the piezoelectric battery,madeline g,11/19/13 10:01
SecondGame_PAM_9,The Difference is ROM so we can pick either one lets not do both,cameron i,11/19/13 10:01

SecondGame_Electric_9,"Because even though ROM6 looks better, the recharge interval is very low",justin y,11/19/13 10:04
SecondGame_Electric_9,"Alright, last thing is ROM then, I found ROM 5 to be the best",justin y,11/19/13 10:04
SecondGame_PAM_9,yeah except the ROM is a 6 not 5,daniel t,11/19/13 10:04
SecondGame_Electric_9,Yeah I think a ROM of 5 works.,brent p,11/19/13 10:05
SecondGame_Electric_9,"Okay, do we want to keep it consistent throughout then? Or change it for certain prototypes?",justin y,11/19/13 10:05
SecondGame_Electric_9,^^agreed. ROM 5 is a good balance between recharge interval and payload/agility,madeline g,11/19/13 10:05

SecondGame_Hydraulic_11,It is clear that there is no clear single best protoype,samuel o,11/21/13 10:04
SecondGame_Hydraulic_11,I think the increased payload of all the prototypes took away from other categories like recharge interval and safety,shane t,11/21/13 10:04
SecondGame_PAM_11,yes we did we said the suit was no good to the workers if it wasn't charged but it wasnt good charged if it didn't have a good payload,cameron i,11/21/13 10:04

SecondGame_PAM_11,"we had to sacrifice some aspects in order to keep the device safe, such as the payload",cormick u,11/21/13 10:04
SecondGame_Hydraulic_11,We wanted to test certain aspects by testing them directly against each other,jackson p,11/21/13 10:05

SecondGame_PAM_11,yeah and for some reason our safety numbers are high still,cameron i,11/21/13 10:05
SecondGame_PAM_11,I believe that it was a successful trial because we now have an understanding of how each thing affects the device,cormick u,11/21/13 10:05
SecondGame_PAM_11,Using the resources we tried to  maintain a strong balance,daniel t,11/21/13 10:05
SecondGame_PAM_11,Our payload was too low but overall successful,daniel t,11/21/13 10:05

SecondGame_PAM_11,well i don't think the drop in ROM was worth it,cormick u,11/21/13 10:06
SecondGame_PAM_11,How much the ROM affects the design,nicholas l,11/21/13 10:06
SecondGame_PAM_11,I also think it all starts with the base material,cameron i,11/21/13 10:07

SecondGame_1_12,"He's not saying the sensor, he's saying which things do we want to focus on, like the cost, safety, agility, payload or recharge interval I think",derek v,11/26/13 9:46
SecondGame_1_12,ok i misread it sorry,jackson p,11/26/13 9:46
SecondGame_3_12,Well what can we change to bring the cost down?,casey f,11/26/13 9:46
SecondGame_3_12,"it was composite, PFC, electric, Piezoelectric, and ROM 5",justin y,11/26/13 9:46
SecondGame_3_12,I just made an updated comparison sheet. You guys can open it.,keegan q,11/26/13 9:46
SecondGame_3_12,Yea i think that's the best one so far,nicholas n,11/26/13 9:46
SecondGame_4_12,does anyone have any results that satisfy all three of those?,daniel t,11/26/13 9:46
SecondGame_1_12,"So, what do we want to focus on?",brent p,11/26/13 9:47
SecondGame_1_12,"No problem, I think we should focus on safety",derek v,11/26/13 9:47
SecondGame_1_12,and then what?,derek v,11/26/13 9:47
SecondGame_2_12,@James: I think Piezoelectric,nathan d,11/26/13 9:47
SecondGame_3_12,Changing to a lower ROM i think will lower the cost,nicholas n,11/26/13 9:47
SecondGame_4_12,"My device has a pretty good safety, payload, agility, and recharge interval; the cost is a little high though",madeline g,11/26/13 9:47
SecondGame_1_12,Same here,brent p,11/26/13 9:48
SecondGame_1_12,i think recharge interval is pretty important too,cormick u,11/26/13 9:48
SecondGame_1_12,i agree,cormick u,11/26/13 9:48
SecondGame_1_12,I think safety and cost are the two most important,jackson p,11/26/13 9:48
SecondGame_2_12,Did anyone satisfy most of the consultants?,cameron i,11/26/13 9:48
SecondGame_2_12,Did anyone satisfy most of the consultants?,cameron i,11/26/13 9:48
SecondGame_2_12,"@Cameron: agility yes, payload yes, everything else no",samuel o,11/26/13 9:48
SecondGame_3_12,"lowering rom would increase recharge interval, but lower agility and payload",justin y,11/26/13 9:48
SecondGame_4_12,"same here. I have one that has good scores for the categories, but is set at 15440 dollars",shane t,11/26/13 9:48
SecondGame_5_12,I think thats a good idea,caitlyn y,11/26/13 9:48
SecondGame_1_12,okay,brent p,11/26/13 9:49
SecondGame_1_12,sounds good to me,derek v,11/26/13 9:49
SecondGame_1_12,that sounds good,jackson p,11/26/13 9:49
SecondGame_1_12,so we can focus on those three while making our new designs then,luke u,11/26/13 9:49
SecondGame_2_12,yeah,cameron i,11/26/13 9:49
SecondGame_2_12,yeah,cameron i,11/26/13 9:49
SecondGame_2_12,recharge interval is important too... can we replace one of the component in the design to make up this aspect a bit,ruzhen e,11/26/13 9:49
SecondGame_2_12,@Cameron: Any of our five designs?,samuel o,11/26/13 9:49
SecondGame_3_12,I think the series elastic one looks like it performed the best,keegan q,11/26/13 9:49
SecondGame_3_12,Let's try it.,nicholas n,11/26/13 9:49
SecondGame_4_12,What's everyone's range for safety cause I feel mine  is very high 191-229,christina b,11/26/13 9:49

SecondGame_5_12,Each person is going to make a prototype using their own actuator,brandon f,11/26/13 9:49
SecondGame_5_12,sorry guys im also a bit confused as to which actuator we are using. can someone recap what we've decided as a group,kiana k,11/26/13 9:49
SecondGame_5_12,@Brittany: I agree but we should still try to get at least and average payload,kiana k,11/26/13 9:49
SecondGame_5_12,@Brandon: thanks,kiana k,11/26/13 9:49
SecondGame_2_12,"@James: To maximize safety with series elastic, I would try Steel, PFC, and Optic-binary or strain gauge",nathan d,11/26/13 9:50
SecondGame_2_12,"No, none of them were safe enough and cost too much.  They were at least pretty close to having good enough recharge interval.  They were awesome for payload and agility",samuel o,11/26/13 9:50
SecondGame_3_12,"We could create prototypes with the same specs, but each one changing a different aspect to lower cost",casey f,11/26/13 9:50
SecondGame_3_12,Did you guys look at the design comparison?,keegan q,11/26/13 9:50
SecondGame_4_12,162-202,abigail z,11/26/13 9:50
SecondGame_4_12,188-230,daniel t,11/26/13 9:50
SecondGame_4_12,for electric it is 190-230,madeline g,11/26/13 9:50
SecondGame_4_12,"same here for hydraulic, 190-235",shane t,11/26/13 9:50
SecondGame_5_12,I don't think we have decided as a group. We are all going to make a prototype that we think is the best from our last batch and see which one yields the best results from there.,caitlyn y,11/26/13 9:50
SecondGame_1_12,i think that we should stick to the NiCd owed source. I don't know about you guys but it worked the best for my previous group,cormick u,11/26/13 9:51
SecondGame_3_12,"No problem, which designs are we thinking about testing further?",keegan q,11/26/13 9:51
SecondGame_5_12,I think we should focus on getting as close to the requirements for each output as possible to create a well rounded device. Focusing on one output could lead to very poor performance in other areas.,brandon f,11/26/13 9:51

SecondGame_1_12,Yeah I was planning on using that as well,luke u,11/26/13 9:52
SecondGame_2_12,@James: 5,nathan d,11/26/13 9:52
SecondGame_2_12,If everyone else want to try it I would say yes,nathan d,11/26/13 9:52
SecondGame_2_12,what the bottom line of the safety?,ruzhen e,11/26/13 9:52
SecondGame_3_12,I think we should have at least 2 series elastic designs.,nicholas n,11/26/13 9:52
SecondGame_5_12,"Did someone's prototypes meet all or almost most of the requirements? If so, they should do two",brandon f,11/26/13 9:52
SecondGame_5_12,"Did someone's prototypes meet all or almost most of the requirements? If so, they should do two",brandon f,11/26/13 9:52

SecondGame_3_12,"The hydraulic looks like it has potential, the payload is very high.",keegan q,11/26/13 9:53
SecondGame_3_12,@Casey: are there any good designs of yours that have a safety of under 200?,keegan q,11/26/13 9:53
SecondGame_4_12,"Okay so should we choose either mine/Shane's prototypes, which are good in all categories except cost, or try to find another prototype that does not have such a high cost?",madeline g,11/26/13 9:53
SecondGame_5_12,neither did mine,brandon f,11/26/13 9:53
SecondGame_5_12,neither did mine,brandon f,11/26/13 9:53
SecondGame_5_12,Me neither,caitlyn y,11/26/13 9:53
SecondGame_1_12,"I mean I know some of the power sources seem to work better, but wouldn't it matter more what device we is than what power source we use?",derek v,11/26/13 9:54
SecondGame_1_12,we use*,derek v,11/26/13 9:54
SecondGame_2_12,"how do you guys feel about this idea? Alum, PFC, Peizoelectric, Hydraulic, and whatever rom works best with this actuator?",cameron i,11/26/13 9:54
SecondGame_2_12,"how do you guys feel about this idea? Alum, PFC, Peizoelectric, Hydraulic, and whatever rom works best with this actuator?",cameron i,11/26/13 9:54
SecondGame_2_12,ROM 5 is best for electric,ruzhen e,11/26/13 9:54
SecondGame_3_12,190 and 198 are the lowest I got it,casey f,11/26/13 9:54
SecondGame_3_12,yeah I have two but they are barely under,casey f,11/26/13 9:54
SecondGame_3_12,@Casey: Which one is better?,keegan q,11/26/13 9:54
SecondGame_5_12,@Justin Kim: What do we do since we missing a group member?,brandon f,11/26/13 9:54
SecondGame_5_12,@Justin Kim: What do we do since we missing a group member?,brandon f,11/26/13 9:54
SecondGame_1_12,It worked fairly well with the electric actuator,brent p,11/26/13 9:55
SecondGame_1_12,the NiCd was the only power source that was successful for the Pneumatic Artificial Muscle Actuated System,cormick u,11/26/13 9:55
SecondGame_1_12,well the power source is going to work better regardless of what is around it. NiCd has its ups and downs but overall it is better,jackson p,11/26/13 9:55
SecondGame_1_12,than the other ones,jackson p,11/26/13 9:55
SecondGame_1_12,i would say,jackson p,11/26/13 9:55
SecondGame_2_12,Okay thanks,cameron i,11/26/13 9:55
SecondGame_2_12,Okay thanks,cameron i,11/26/13 9:55
SecondGame_2_12,I like it,nathan d,11/26/13 9:55
SecondGame_2_12,ROM three seemed to be the best for hydraulic actuator,samuel o,11/26/13 9:55
SecondGame_3_12,For 190 safety we got a 924 payload and 230 agility with 6.05 recharge,casey f,11/26/13 9:55
SecondGame_3_12,Oh and 14240 for cost,casey f,11/26/13 9:55
SecondGame_3_12,"the 190 got a 932 payload with 254 agility and 6.27 recharge, but it costs 15440",casey f,11/26/13 9:55
SecondGame_5_12,again im playing catch up so probably not a good idea for me to make two,kiana k,11/26/13 9:55
SecondGame_3_12,Ok I updated the comparison again. The hydraulic looks pretty good,keegan q,11/26/13 9:56
SecondGame_3_12,If we try lowering the ROM on both of those we could lower the cost a bit and still have a well rounded device,nicholas n,11/26/13 9:56
SecondGame_3_12,on both of Casey's designs,nicholas n,11/26/13 9:56
SecondGame_4_12,We should choose our 3 best prototypes and then try to improve 2 of them by   changing something,christina b,11/26/13 9:56
SecondGame_4_12,"I have some changes i could make to mine, to increase recharge interval and decrease cost",shane t,11/26/13 9:56
SecondGame_5_12,but i have two that my first team made that seemed to do well overall,kiana k,11/26/13 9:56
SecondGame_1_12,alright,derek v,11/26/13 9:57
SecondGame_2_12,"Okay what about series elastic, NiCd, Optic Binary, Steel and ROM 5...open to opinion on it",cameron i,11/26/13 9:57

SecondGame_3_12,Anyone have any preferences that definitely should be in?,justin y,11/26/13 9:58
SecondGame_3_12,series electric for sure. and hydraulic,keegan q,11/26/13 9:58

SecondGame_2_12,"@Cameron: I like it, but ROM 5 will get the lowest recharge interval",nathan d,11/26/13 9:59
SecondGame_3_12,"okay, does anyone like the pneumatic and PAM or should we eliminate them?",justin y,11/26/13 9:59
SecondGame_4_12,Shane and Madeline could each design two prototypes because it sounds like their actuators are the strongest in the categories we prioritize and the rest of us could choose one more,daniel t,11/26/13 9:59
SecondGame_4_12,"@Justin Kim: Thats what i was planning.  switching composite to to aluminum, since there is room to sacrifice strength in my design",shane t,11/26/13 9:59

SecondGame_4_12,Alright i created the batch!,abigail z,11/26/13 10:11
SecondGame_4_12,I created a prototype on the redd so you can just add it to the batch,christina b,11/26/13 10:11
SecondGame_2_12,the batch hasn't shown up in my REDD yet,cameron i,11/26/13 10:12
SecondGame_2_12,the batch hasn't shown up in my REDD yet,cameron i,11/26/13 10:12
SecondGame_2_12,i collected them and made the batch. can u see it now?,ruzhen e,11/26/13 10:13
SecondGame_3_12,Casey had hydraulic,keegan q,11/26/13 10:13
SecondGame_3_12,Ok i just need the last two for  hydraulic,nicholas n,11/26/13 10:13
SecondGame_2_12,"@Cameron: ... after i refresh my window, it disappears...why",ruzhen e,11/26/13 10:14
SecondGame_3_12,@Casey: What were the best specs for your actuator?,nicholas n,11/26/13 10:14
SecondGame_2_12,Yeah i still dont have it,cameron i,11/26/13 10:15
SecondGame_2_12,Yeah i still dont have it,cameron i,11/26/13 10:15
SecondGame_3_12,He never said the specs,keegan q,11/26/13 10:15
SecondGame_3_12,I can't find the specs for the ones he told us about,nicholas n,11/26/13 10:15
SecondGame_2_12,Ill just make it on mine too,cameron i,11/26/13 10:16
SecondGame_2_12,Ill just make it on mine too,cameron i,11/26/13 10:16
SecondGame_2_12,neither do I,nathan d,11/26/13 10:16
SecondGame_2_12,can't find iit...,ruzhen e,11/26/13 10:16
SecondGame_3_12,Should we just make new designs using hydraulic?,nicholas n,11/26/13 10:16
SecondGame_2_12,I see team 2 final batch now,nathan d,11/26/13 10:17
SecondGame_2_12,I see it now\,samuel o,11/26/13 10:17
SecondGame_3_12,"How about aluminum, piezoelectric, LiPO and ROM 4",nicholas n,11/26/13 10:17
SecondGame_3_12,and then for the second one ROM 3?,nicholas n,11/26/13 10:17
SecondGame_2_12,yea get it,ruzhen e,11/26/13 10:18
SecondGame_3_12,"He said "" That device used steal, NiCd, Hydraulic, Strain-Gauge and ROM 3"" for the one with high safety",keegan q,11/26/13 10:18
SecondGame_3_12,Alright i made the batch,nicholas n,11/26/13 10:19
SecondGame_3_12,thanks,keegan q,11/26/13 10:22
SecondGame_3_12,No problem,nicholas n,11/26/13 10:22
SecondGame_3_12,Have a good thanksgiving guys,nicholas n,11/26/13 10:22
SecondGame_5_12,Hey guys sorry i missed out on the meeting i was traveling and had no access to internet. But i like the batch you guys made. Just as background info my acuator was the PAM and it had a high agility but very low payload,nicholas l,11/26/13 12:45
SecondGame_1_12,@Justin Kim: not exactly,cormick u,12/3/13 9:36
SecondGame_1_12,@Justin Kim: no finishing it now,cormick u,12/3/13 9:37
SecondGame_4_12,were we supposed to receive an email? i am a little confused.,abigail z,12/3/13 9:39
SecondGame_4_12,I'm pretty sure i had everything turned in on time so I don't know why i haven't received it yet!,abigail z,12/3/13 9:45
SecondGame_4_12,"Oh you're right I thought I already did that, but it was for my last group.",abigail z,12/3/13 9:48
SecondGame_2_14,ok,cameron i,12/3/13 9:58
SecondGame_2_14,ok,cameron i,12/3/13 9:58
SecondGame_2_14,"well, I find the safety we were intended to improve is not really promoted as we designed to",ruzhen e,12/3/13 9:58
SecondGame_2_14,I don't know about you guys but i really like #5 or #2,cameron i,12/3/13 9:59
SecondGame_2_14,I don't know about you guys but i really like #5 or #2,cameron i,12/3/13 9:59
SecondGame_2_14,I thought 5 was great,nathan d,12/3/13 9:59
SecondGame_2_14,me too. I prefer #5,ruzhen e,12/3/13 9:59
SecondGame_2_14,I like dsign 5 a lot,samuel o,12/3/13 9:59
SecondGame_2_14,I know its not the safest but it is only 3 points over what DeShawn wanted. and the recharge will do.,cameron i,12/3/13 10:00
SecondGame_2_14,I know its not the safest but it is only 3 points over what DeShawn wanted. and the recharge will do.,cameron i,12/3/13 10:00
SecondGame_2_14,but... the safety of #5 is not ideal enough,ruzhen e,12/3/13 10:00
SecondGame_2_14,#5 safety is comprable to our designs also,samuel o,12/3/13 10:00
SecondGame_2_14,yeah I just wish the agility on #2 was higher. that would have been a great design,cameron i,12/3/13 10:01
SecondGame_2_14,yeah I just wish the agility on #2 was higher. that would have been a great design,cameron i,12/3/13 10:01
SecondGame_2_14,"The safety is really not bad on this design (5), and the improvements in other areas were very good",nathan d,12/3/13 10:01
SecondGame_2_14,@Cameron: the safety point of Deshawn u mentioned is the bedrock or the ideal standard?,ruzhen e,12/3/13 10:01
SecondGame_2_14,He recommended no higher than 199 but the company high is 225,cameron i,12/3/13 10:02
SecondGame_2_14,He recommended no higher than 199 but the company high is 225,cameron i,12/3/13 10:02
SecondGame_2_14,I feel that the benefits in other aspects of design 5 outweigh the drwback of not so great saftey,samuel o,12/3/13 10:02
SecondGame_2_14,@Samuel: I would have to agree,nathan d,12/3/13 10:03
SecondGame_2_14,"yea the payload, agility and cost are excellent",ruzhen e,12/3/13 10:03
SecondGame_1_14,It doesn't clear the payload requirement only,derek v,12/3/13 10:05
SecondGame_1_14,The results from the batch did not give a clear winner. I think the two best ones are Lukes and Dereks,jackson p,12/3/13 10:05
SecondGame_1_14,Of the last five that we tested I think Derek's met the most IC requests,luke u,12/3/13 10:05
SecondGame_2_14,The only thing I can say is do we want to sacrifice agility to bring down safety and raise recharge with number 2,cameron i,12/3/13 10:05
SecondGame_2_14,The only thing I can say is do we want to sacrifice agility to bring down safety and raise recharge with number 2,cameron i,12/3/13 10:05
SecondGame_4_12,I think my favorite is batch 2 design 3,abigail z,12/3/13 10:05
SecondGame_1_14,Yeah I thought the Pneumatic(Derek)  was the best overall,brent p,12/3/13 10:06
SecondGame_1_14,and it misses that by a significant amount,derek v,12/3/13 10:06
SecondGame_1_14,I like mine and Luke's the best,derek v,12/3/13 10:06
SecondGame_2_14,Its a pretty big hit on safety and agility,nathan d,12/3/13 10:06
SecondGame_2_14,I wonder what's the agility standard said by the internal consultant,ruzhen e,12/3/13 10:06
SecondGame_2_14,So we all agree that we are going to chose design 5 for our final presentation?,samuel o,12/3/13 10:06
SecondGame_4_12,the only thing i don't like about it is the agility.,abigail z,12/3/13 10:06
SecondGame_4_12,but it's not too bad.,abigail z,12/3/13 10:06
SecondGame_1_14,Yep,derek v,12/3/13 10:07
SecondGame_1_14,So we basically need to decide if payload or recharge interval is more important,luke u,12/3/13 10:07
SecondGame_2_14,"Okay i was just pointing out how close #2 is to #5 just with bad agility, but i agree on #5 as well. and the agility standard is a min of 122 but they would like to see it in the 200s",cameron i,12/3/13 10:07
SecondGame_2_14,"Okay i was just pointing out how close #2 is to #5 just with bad agility, but i agree on #5 as well. and the agility standard is a min of 122 but they would like to see it in the 200s",cameron i,12/3/13 10:07
SecondGame_1_14,@Derek: I agree as well,brent p,12/3/13 10:08
SecondGame_1_14,I'm going with recharge interval because from the previous designs from before it said that one of the biggest problems was the recharge interval of the current devices,derek v,12/3/13 10:08
SecondGame_1_14,"I agree, the payload can only account for so much if it isnt being used due to an uncharged battery",jackson p,12/3/13 10:08
SecondGame_2_14,"okay, is that what we all agree on then is 5?",cameron i,12/3/13 10:08
SecondGame_2_14,"okay, is that what we all agree on then is 5?",cameron i,12/3/13 10:08
SecondGame_2_14,@Cameron: then i still choose #5,ruzhen e,12/3/13 10:08
SecondGame_1_14,With that in mind I would choose dereks prototype,jackson p,12/3/13 10:09
SecondGame_1_14,and i agree,jackson p,12/3/13 10:09
SecondGame_1_14,"I agree as well, so there is our decison",luke u,12/3/13 10:09
SecondGame_2_14,I think it sounds good,nathan d,12/3/13 10:09
SecondGame_1_14,it covers the most IC requests,cormick u,12/3/13 10:10
SecondGame_1_14,it seems to be the best well rounded device when everything is put into account,cormick u,12/3/13 10:10
SecondGame_1_14,"My prototype, it was the pneumatic with piezoelectic sensors, NiCd battery, composite material and the ROM of 3",derek v,12/3/13 10:10
SecondGame_1_14,We chose the prototype derek made because it had excellent recharge interval which was a main design focus. It also is great at cost and safety,jackson p,12/3/13 10:10
SecondGame_1_14,"It covered more of the things that we prioritized earlier, we said safety, cost, and recharge interval seemed to be the most important to our group and this design covers those parameters and does well as an overall device",derek v,12/3/13 10:11
SecondGame_1_14,except for payload but we determined that recharge interval was more important,jackson p,12/3/13 10:11
SecondGame_2_14,"@Nassim Tehrani: it almost satisfies everyone. And where it doesn't meet their standards it comes very close to it. It comes closer than the other devices though for sure. We lack a little in cost, safety, and recharge, but we are very close the values.",cameron i,12/3/13 10:11
SecondGame_2_14,"@Nassim Tehrani: it almost satisfies everyone. And where it doesn't meet their standards it comes very close to it. It comes closer than the other devices though for sure. We lack a little in cost, safety, and recharge, but we are very close the values.",cameron i,12/3/13 10:11
SecondGame_4_12,"yes, and probably for team 4 prototype also.",abigail z,12/3/13 10:11
SecondGame_1_14,we tried to meet at least the minimum of each of the internal consultants request.,cormick u,12/3/13 10:12
SecondGame_1_14,"They gave us a set of guidelines more or less to follow when creating the devices of what we should aim for, the decision in the end though was up to us and we were looking for the concerns related to the person who would be using the suit and prioritized those needs.",derek v,12/3/13 10:12
SecondGame_1_14,They gave us goals for us to meet and shoot for in order to gauge whether our design was successful,jackson p,12/3/13 10:12
SecondGame_2_14,And the cost is the lowest of any of our designs,samuel o,12/3/13 10:12
SecondGame_2_14,@Nassim Tehrani: Yes,samuel o,12/3/13 10:12
SecondGame_1_14,We decided that it needs to be cheap and safe.  Also the payload is important if is needs to be recharge more often,brent p,12/3/13 10:13
SecondGame_1_14,Based on our research we designed something that would be the best for the worker. the most important attributes were recharge interval and cost and safety.,jackson p,12/3/13 10:13
SecondGame_4_12,"i would agree, now we need to decide if agility is more important then payload",abigail z,12/3/13 10:13
SecondGame_1_14,the recharge interval was deemed important because that means the operator could use it longer in the field,cormick u,12/3/13 10:14
SecondGame_1_14,"In our last discussion we decided as a team the we wanted to focus on cost, safety, and recharge interval because those three are probably most important to the user",luke u,12/3/13 10:14
SecondGame_4_12,Good point. I would agree with Daniel.,abigail z,12/3/13 10:14
SecondGame_1_14,correct,cormick u,12/3/13 10:15
SecondGame_4_12,"because the agility, recharge interval and safety are good.",abigail z,12/3/13 10:15
SecondGame_1_14,that sound correct to me,derek v,12/3/13 10:16
SecondGame_1_14,yes,jackson p,12/3/13 10:16
SecondGame_4_12,They gave us reference points to base our opinions on,abigail z,12/3/13 10:18
SecondGame_5_12,Hey guys i'm really sorry I missed the meeting!! I'm still traveling back to Wisconsin from Thanksgiving break and did not have internet access even though I thought I would have it. the pneumatic device sounds like a good option that will suit the needs of the internal consultants .,caitlyn y,12/3/13 13:08
